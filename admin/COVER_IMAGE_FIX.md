# Cover Image Column Fix

## Problem
SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'cover_image' in 'field list'

## Root Cause
The `Edition.php` class was trying to insert into a column named `cover_image`, but the actual database table has the column named `thumbnail_path`.

## Solution Applied
âœ… **Fixed SQL Query**: Changed `Edition::create()` method in `classes/Edition.php`
- **Before**: `INSERT INTO editions (..., cover_image, ...)`  
- **After**: `INSERT INTO editions (..., thumbnail_path, ...)`

âœ… **Updated Comment**: Changed comment to reflect correct mapping
- **Before**: `// This maps to cover_image`
- **After**: `// Maps to thumbnail_path in database`

## Verification
- âœ… Test completed successfully
- âœ… Edition creation works without column errors
- âœ… Database integration confirmed working

## Files Modified
- `classes/Edition.php` - Fixed SQL column reference

## Status
ðŸŽ‰ **RESOLVED** - The cover_image column error is completely fixed and upload system is ready for use.
